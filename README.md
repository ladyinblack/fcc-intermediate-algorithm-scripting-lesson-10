## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
The program has to return a new array of unique values from two original arrays in the order they show up.  So there is not sorting required, and there shouldn't be any duplicates.

## HINTS
### Hint 1
Since you have no idea how many parameters were passed, it would be best to loop through the **arguments** before looping through the arrays.

### Hint 2
It isn't necessary to use loops.  You can use functions such as `map()`, `reduce()` or others if you want.

### Hint 3
You will have to check if the current value is already on the array to be returned for every value.
